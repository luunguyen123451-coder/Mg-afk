# MG AFK Android

MG AFK Android is a lightweight mobile app that lets you stay connected to
Magic Garden without launching the game. It keeps a session open to display
pet ability logs, shop inventory, weather and more while minimizing battery
usage. You can also interact directly from the app: plant seeds and grow
eggs, water and harvest your garden, buy items from shops, chat with other
players, feed and swap your pets, sell crops and pets, lock items, play
casino mini-games, browse public rooms — and when you actually want to
play, hit **Play in game** to launch the game in-app with the Gemini
userscript automatically injected.

## How it works

MG AFK connects to the game's WebSocket endpoint and authenticates using
your Discord account. Incoming data is parsed and displayed across dedicated
sections (dashboard, pets, garden, shops, alerts, mini-games…).

## Login

Tap **Login with Discord** in the Dashboard. A browser window opens on
Discord's OAuth page — log in and the app captures your session token
automatically. The token is stored persistently so you only need to log in
once.

To log out, tap **Logout**. This clears the stored token.

## Navigation

Swipe from the left edge or tap the hamburger menu to open the navigation
drawer. Sections:

| Section     | Content                                                                         |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Dashboard   | Connection setup, live status, **Play in game** (in-app WebView with Gemini)    |
| Room        | Chat with players in the room                                                   |
| Pets        | Active pets, pet teams, ability logs                                            |
| Storage     | Seed silo, inventory, feeding trough, pet hutch (with Magic Dust upgrades), decor shed |
| Garden      | Plant seeds, water, harvest, pot plants, cleanse mutations, grow/hatch eggs     |
| Shops       | Buy seeds / tools / eggs / decors (single, bulk, hybrid modes)                  |
| Social      | Browse and join public rooms                                                    |
| Mini Games  | Coin Flip, Mines, Slots, Dice, Crash, Blackjack, Egg Hatcher (casino wallet, deposit / withdraw) |
| Alerts      | Per-section or per-item notification / alarm config (shops, weather, pets, trough) |
| Settings    | Background & battery, reconnection, purchase mode, storages auto-stock, alarm (sound, volume, schedule), developer options |
| Debug       | WebSocket logs, service logs, alert testing                                     |

Sections that require an active connection are greyed out when offline.
The Debug section is hidden by default and can be enabled in Settings.

## Multiple accounts

MG AFK supports multiple sessions. Use the tabs bar to add a new account (+)
and switch between sessions. Each tab keeps its own login, room code, and
reconnect settings.

## Background & lock screen

The app runs in the background even when the phone is locked using a
foreground service. A Wi-Fi lock keeps the network active and an optional
CPU wake lock (off, smart, or always) prevents the system from sleeping
during long AFK sessions. The smart mode automatically enables the CPU lock
after the phone has been locked for a configurable delay and releases it on
unlock.

If the WebSocket disconnects, the app retries indefinitely with exponential
backoff and reconnects immediately when the network comes back. An optional
notification can alert you when a session loses connection.

The Settings → Background & Battery section also includes a **Battery
Optimization** shortcut: it shows whether the app is currently "Optimized"
(the system can pause it in the background) or "Unrestricted", and tapping
either button opens the corresponding Android system settings page so you
can flip it.

## Updates

MG AFK checks GitHub Releases every hour and posts a system notification
when a new version is available. A green **Update vX.Y.Z** button also
appears at the top of the navigation drawer — tap it to download and
install the new APK directly from the app, no Play Store required.

## Pets

The Pets section shows your active pets with hunger bars, STR stats, and
ability badges with dynamic colors from the game data. Tap a pet to feed it
from your produce, swap it with another pet from inventory/hutch, or remove
it. Empty slots can be filled by equipping a pet directly.

**Pet Teams** let you save and switch between up to 30 pre-configured teams
of 3 pets. One tap activates a team, instantly swapping your active pets.

**Ability logs** show a detailed description for each proc (e.g. "Snail
found 25552 coins", "Turtle reduced 1 plant growth by 4m 54s") alongside a
colored ability badge matching the game UI.

Every pet and crop sprite across the app renders with its current mutations
baked in (Gold, Rainbow, Wet, Frozen, Ambershine, Dawnlit, etc.) — no more
plain icons; you see at a glance what each pet or produce looks like.

## Garden

The Garden section mirrors your in-game plot. You can:
- Plant seeds onto free tiles.
- Water growing plants to speed up growth.
- Harvest mature crops from single-slot and multi-slot plants.
- Pot a grown plant back into your inventory using Planter Pots.
- **Cleanse mutations** off a crop with a Crop Cleanser tool — available
  on both single-crop and multi-slot plant dialogs (per-slot for the
  latter), disabled when the crop has no mutation or you have no Cleanser.
- Grow and hatch eggs into pets.

Multi-slot plants (Moonbinder, trees, Camellia…) are rendered like in the
game: the full plant illustration with each crop placed at the correct slot
position, sized by its `targetScale` and composited with its own mutations.

## Storage

Inventory, feeding trough, seed silo, pet hutch, and decor shed — each
category shows its contents with rarity borders and quantity badges. The
Celestial border is animated with the same blue → violet → gold gradient
as the in-game badge.

- **Sell pets**: sell individual pets with a price preview, or bulk-sell
  all unlocked pets. Both the per-pet preview and the totals show the
  **Magic Dust** value alongside the gold price.
- **Sell crops**: sell individual produce, or bulk-sell all unlocked crops.
  Prices include the friends-bonus (×1.0 to ×1.5 based on room size).
- **Lock / unlock items**: tap any item to open its detail popup, then
  toggle the lock to protect it from being sold.
- **Multi-slot plants**: the detail dialog shows each crop slot with its
  growth bar, mutations, and individual sell price, plus a Plant in Garden
  button.
- **Move between inventory and storages**: pet, seed and decor detail
  popups have **Move to Pet Hutch / Seed Silo / Decor Shed** buttons (and
  vice-versa from the storage side). Buttons are disabled when the
  destination is full.
- **Pet Hutch upgrades**: the hutch panel shows your dust balance, current
  capacity, and a one-tap **Upgrade** button when you have enough dust to
  unlock the next capacity tier (max level 10).
- **Seed Silo upgrades**: same panel pattern in the Seed Silo card — 5
  tiers add +5 capacity each (25 → 50) for a Magic Dust cost per tier.
- **Auto-stock**: in Settings → Storages, toggles **Auto-stock Seed Silo**
  / **Auto-stock Decor Shed** automatically move newly-acquired stackable
  items into the matching storage slot.

## Shops

Three purchase modes are available (configurable in Settings):
- **Bulk** (default): tap buys all remaining stock at once.
- **Hybrid**: tap to buy x1, long-press to buy all remaining stock.
- **Single**: tap always buys x1.

Items you already own at max — tools at their stack cap (Watering Can,
Crop Cleanser at 99) and one-time-purchase items (Shovel, mutation
potions, Seed Silo / Decor Shed / Pet Hutch you already placed) — are
greyed out with an **OWNED** or **MAX** badge so you don't waste taps.

### ⚡ Thunder Shop

Every time a **Thunderstorm** occurs, the **Thunder Shop** appears in the
centre of the village. The app automatically shows it as a weather-conditional
shop card (just like Dawn / Snow shops) — it is hidden when no Thunderstorm
is active.

**New items available in the Thunder Shop:**

#### Celestial: Thunderspire
Fast multi-harvest celestial that grows the **Thunderpeel** crop and
additionally grows **Stormcap** crops during Thunderstorms, allowing it to
hold up to 16 crops at a time (new maximum!).

#### Mutation: Thundercharged
Adds a **7× sell bonus**, making it better than Frozen (6×) — currently the
best "hydro" mutation a crop can have. Ride the **Thunder Wolf** and use its
**Thundercharger** ability to upgrade existing **Thunderstruck** mutations to
Thundercharged on nearby crops.

#### Thunder Egg (Legendary — 400 M coins / 399 Donuts)
Exclusive to the Thunder Shop. Hatches one of three pets:
- **Bat** — Legendary
- **Platypus** — Legendary
- **Thunder Wolf** — Mythical, rideable pet with the chargeable
  **Thundercharger** ability:
  1. Mount your Thunder Wolf.
  2. Press & hold **Thundercharger** to replace **Thunderstruck** with
     **Thundercharged** mutations on nearby crops.
  3. ~5 minute base cooldown (stronger wolves recharge faster).

#### New Seeds
- **Cattail** — Rare, single-harvest patch (chance of a Variegated Cattail)
- **Cardoon** — Legendary, single-harvest
- **Prickly Pear** — Mythical, multi-harvest
- **Milkcap** — Divine, single-harvest

#### New Decor
- **Moon & Star Windchime** — Rare, makes sound when you walk near or on them
- **Wind Spinner** — Mythical, animated decor
- **Wind Turner** — Divine, animated spinning decor
- Spooky classics from last Halloween: **Gravestones** (Common, Uncommon &
  Rare) + the **Cauldron** (Legendary)

## Watchlist

The **Watchlist** lets you automatically buy items the moment they restock in
any shop — including the Thunder Shop. Add items from any shop card using the
watchlist button; the app monitors every restock cycle in the background and
buys the full available stock when a match appears.

Supported `shopType` values:

| shopType  | Shop                        | Notes                              |
|-----------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------|
| `seed`    | Seeds                       | Restocks every 5 min               |
| `tool`    | Tools                       | Restocks every 10 min              |
| `egg`     | Eggs                        | Restocks every 15 min              |
| `decor`   | Decors                      | Restocks every 60 min              |
| `thunder` | Thunder Shop                | Active only during Thunderstorms   |

**Example Thunder Shop watchlist entries:**
- `shopType = "thunder"`, `itemId = "ThunderEgg"` — snags a Thunder Egg the
  instant the shop opens.
- `shopType = "thunder"`, `itemId = "PricklyPear"` — auto-buys the Mythical
  Prickly Pear seed on restock.

## Social

Browse public rooms fetched from the Aries Mod API. Each entry shows the
host's avatar and the room's player count — tap **Join** to switch rooms
instantly.

## Mini Games

A full casino with a dedicated wallet:
- **Deposit**: transfer in-game breads into the casino (amount capped by
  game-side limits).
- **Withdraw**: the casino sends breads back to your in-game account via
  the `/doughnate` command. Since the game refuses a doughnate that would
  push your balance past **2,000,000**, the app refreshes your in-game
  balance on every withdraw action and caps the withdraw amount at
  `min(casinoBalance, 2,000,000 − gameBalance)` so you never lose coins to
  a failed transfer.

Games available: **Coin Flip, Mines, Slots, Dice, Crash, Blackjack, Egg
Hatcher**. The Egg Hatcher animates the hatch with per-pet mutation (Gold,
Rainbow) composed directly on the sprite.

## Play in game

When you actually want to play (not just AFK), tap **Play in game** on the
Dashboard. The app opens a full-screen WebView pre-authenticated with your
session cookie — no need to log back in.

By default the latest [Gemini userscript](https://github.com/Ariedam64/Gemini)
is downloaded from the GitHub releases and injected on every launch with
GM_* polyfills (storage, version detection, and a native HTTP bridge that
bypasses the WebView's CORS for cross-origin mod requests). You can also
toggle **Inject Gemini mod** off to play vanilla.

To avoid the game kicking your AFK WebSocket, the AFK session is
automatically paused when you tap Play and resumes when you close the
WebView. Play opens in immersive mode (status and navigation bars hidden)
for a true full-screen experience.

## Alerts

MG AFK can notify you about shop restocks, weather changes, low pet hunger,
and feeding trough levels. Each section (Shop / Weather / Pet / Trough) has
three modes:

- **Notification**: silent system notification when the alert fires.
- **Alarm**: full-screen alarm with looping sound and vibration until
  dismissed — useful when you're not looking at the phone.
- **Custom**: pick the mode per item. Long-press a shop tile to flip it
  between notification and alarm; switch-based items (Weather, Pet, Trough)
  get an inline bell/alarm toggle next to their switch.

Alerts work in the background and when the phone is locked.

**Alarm settings** (Settings → Alarm) let you choose a custom ringtone,
adjust the alarm volume with a live test button, and define a silence
schedule with day-of-week selection — alarms are downgraded to silent
notifications during the configured hours, perfect for muting at night
or during recurring meetings.

## Sprite cache

Sprites are loaded from the Magic Garden API and cached locally via Coil —
256 MB of persistent disk cache survives app restarts, so composed mutation
sprites aren't re-fetched between sessions.

## Build

Prerequisites:
- Android Studio (latest stable)
- JDK 17+
- Android SDK 35

Open the project in Android Studio and run on a device/emulator, or build
from the command line:

```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

The debug APK will be in `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/`.

## Credits

- WebSocket message parsing and actions are based on [MG-Websocket-Helper](https://github.com/Ariedam64/MG-Websocket-Helper).
- Sprites, composed mutation sprites and game data are fetched from the unofficial game API: [Magic-Garden-API](https://github.com/Ariedam64/Magic-Garden-API).
- Public room browsing uses the [Aries Mod API](https://github.com/Ariedam64/mg-api-front-ariesMod).

## Tech stack

- Kotlin + Jetpack Compose (Material 3)
- OkHttp (WebSocket)
- Kotlinx Serialization
- Coil (sprite loading + persistent image cache)
- DataStore (persistent settings)
